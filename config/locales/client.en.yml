        <strong>Welcome to ContinuousSecurity.org.</strong>
        You are free to browse and consume any content here, however, to participate in the discussions, you will need to have an account on the web site. To start an account you will need to be invited by an existing member of the community. The community will be growing at a controlled pace, so we’re sure you will find someone you know in the community eventually who can provide an invitation for you.  In the mean time, we hope you find the content useful, and appreciate your interest.
