          <p>ContinuousSecurity.org is a community focused on secure software development, founded by modern companies with a common interest in promoting secure software. The founding organizations include New Relic, Etsy, Amazon, Box, LinkedIn, ZenDesk, Riot Games, and SRC:CLR.</p>
          <p>Our goal is to provide a community fueled by highly relevant, and highly curated content. To reach this goal we are exposing all content on the site to the public, but membership to the community is by invitation only. As the community matures, established members will be inviting more contributors to the community.</p>
          <p>If you are interested in learning about the principles driving the concept of ContinuousSecurity, you can find them in <a href="/table-of-contents">chapter 2</a> of the book content.</p>

        <strong>Welcome to ContinuousSecurity.org.</strong>
        You are free to browse and consume any content here, however, to participate in the discussions, you will need to have an account on the web site. To start an account you will need to be invited by an existing member of the community. The community will be growing at a controlled pace, so we’re sure you will find someone you know in the community eventually who can provide an invitation for you.  In the mean time, we hope you find the content useful, and appreciate your interest.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thanks,
        <br>
        The ContinuousSecurity.org founders

          </p>
          <p>
            If you would like to start a local chapter, please use the following form. Once approved, a new group will be created on Meetup.com and the fees will be handled by ContinuousSecurity.org. Your Meetup.com ID number will be used to promote you to moderator for the community. After this occurs, the community will be in your hands to manage.
          </p>
          <p>Thanks for your interest in running a community!</p>
